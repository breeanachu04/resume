<h2> About Me </h2> 
<center> <p> Hi I am <strong> Breeana Chu </strong> , and 14 years old and fully prepared to be hired for my first job. I am a <strong> motivated, reflective and brave. </strong> 
I make sure I finish my jobs do things my very best. When I make a mistake I <strong>reflect </strong> upon my mistakes and work on my weaknesses. I am also<strong> brave </strong>
 and open to new opportunities and<strong> take risks </strong>. I have lots of experience with working with others and taking part of volunteer and clubs. 
 I learned to have <strong> sportsmanship </strong> and to <strong>respect </strong> others during my experience of playing volleyball.
 We all worked together as a team to win while treating each other fairly
 while always cheering each other on when a
 mistake is made. <strong> By getting hired by your company I will treat all with respect and fairness and show up to work working my hardest. </strong> </center>
